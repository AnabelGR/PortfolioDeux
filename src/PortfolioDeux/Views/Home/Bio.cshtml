                        I have been designing since 1994. I began as an Art Director for Boise Weekly after six weeks as the ad designer. I learned all the pre-Adobe products on the job and stayed on for four years continually updating the design, implementing a website, and changing the printing process from paper seperations to digital pdf submissions. I kept working in the newsprint industry primarily with jobs at The Rocket, Willamette Week, Portland Mercury, and Just Out.

                        My knowledge of both digital and print publication continues. I am currently working as a full stack developer for Apparent Systems where I am working on C# coding and designing catalogs for our clients. I also developed and maintained the website for Rising Room Gallery and produced the print artists books published for each exhibition through Lulu.

                        I have a Bachelor’s degree in English, a Master’s degree in Book Publishing, and most recently, took an intensive 20-week coding academy with hands-on experience using .Net languages to create and implement software applications. I enjoy being challenged by projects that require me to work outside of my comfort and knowledge set. Continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me.
